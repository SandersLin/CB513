mathematical computations to produce efﬁcient low-level implementations. In
this paper, we present new features and efﬁciency improvements to Theano, and
benchmarks demonstrating Theano’s performance relative to Torch7, a recently
introduced machine learning library, and to RNNLM, a C++ library targeted at
recurrent neural networks.}
